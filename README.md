# Individual Project - Sai Santhosh Yamsani - 015386683

## Description:
The main idea of the project is to create a java application with design patterns and a static database. For every re-run, the changes in the data should not persist.
This application has to permit the customer to buy items, where the customer will be limited on the maximum limit for the particular category. Whenever the customer input prerequisite is fulfilled, a bill sum is calculated and the order is processed else a message incorporating the incorrect quantities is to be displayed.

### Tables in Static Database
Table 1: Dataset - This table contains all the items in the inventory
Table 2: Cards - This table contains the list of credit/debit cards that are being used to make the order.

The input file will contain an order including Items, Quantity needed, and the credit/debit card number.
